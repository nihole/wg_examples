**--0--**

This is an example of complementary statement: '++0++' <-> '--0--' and this means that 

**if '--0--' is true, then '++0++' is false** and vice versa. This is logical 'not'.

This kind of statement is used in 2 different cases:
- as auxiliary statements (nodes of the graph) that allow you to create direct and indirect proofs
- as a minimum cycle that can express 2 facts:
  - there is no explicit arguments to support or refute this statement. In fact, we cannot logically choose between "yes and no"
  - you can thus collapse logical chains if they are not interesting and not leading to an unambiguous conclusion

In this case, '--0--' is an auxiliary statement that allows you to create **direct and indirect proofs** for the statement '++0++'.

The idea is:

A <-> B --d-> C <=> "if C is true then A is true".
