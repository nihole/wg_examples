**--2--**

This is **indirect refutation** of '++0++'. It means that if statement '--2--' is true, then the probability that statement '++0++' is false increases. 

We can read this as: 

**The statement that 'Alice was at home yesterday at 7 p.m.' may be false because 'yesterday at 7 p.m. Eve came to Alice, rang the doorbell, but nobody opened'**.

There is no strong dependency here, because in fact there are many possible reasons why Alice did not open the door.

We can question this statement also creating new 'wave' or 'waves' of contradictions and proofs but for example purpose we considered that statements as a truth. We believe Eve that she really 'yesterday at 7 p.m. Eve came to Alice, rang the doorbell, but nobody opened'.

In this case this statement is a **dead-end node**.

**We will call a node N dead-end if not a single arrow leaves it, including a bidirectional one (compliment), that is, it is not refuted by any statement and may be considered as a truth**
