This is a direct proof of ++0++.
The idea is that the following chain provides direct proof:

'++0++' <-> '--0--' --d-> '++6++' 

It means that if '++6++' is true then '++0++' is also true.

We also have a chain 

'++0++' <-> '--0--' --d-> '++5++'.

The common rule here is "every time we have many descending relationships for some node, the OR logic is used".

In our case, it means that if '++5++' OR '++6++' are true then '++0++' is true (and '--0--' is false).
