**++13++**

This is an example of complementary statement: **'--13--' <-> '++13++'** and this means that 

**if '++13++' is true, then '--13--' is false** and vice versa. This is logical 'not'.

In this case, we use **'--13--' <-> '++13++'** as a minimum cycle at the end of a wave to indicate that there is no solid objective points to support or refute an argument in favor of '++13++' or '--13--'. This means that different people may have different opinions based on their experience and interpretation of the situation. 

This is also a "collapsed" waves of arguments for and against, provided that these waves still do not lead to unambiguous results.

In the case of A <-> B, there is no need to provide a description for both nodes, because logically A is not B, and vice versa, and if we give a description of A, it becomes clear without any description what B is about.
